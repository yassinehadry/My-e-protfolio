This project introduces a web-based application designed to automate the generation of Prometheus monitoring rules from user-defined application metrics specifications. Utilizing Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), the application will transform metrics into detailed Prometheus alerting and recording rules in YAML format. Developed using Spring Boot and React JS, it will provide an intuitive interface for inputting metrics specifications. The backend will process this input, converting it into Prometheus-compatible rules, thus providing users with ready-to-use YAML files for their monitoring setup.
